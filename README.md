# **Codewars Kata Solutions & Translations**

## **The Intent**

I generally prefer to code in my own IDE with my own settings etc. Over a period of time, this has resulted in a mass (a _messy mass_) of saved files in various languages for a chunk of the Kata's I have completed. This repository is my attempt to force myself to clean and organise my solutions directory.

It also presents an opportunity for me to incorporate Git into the workflow of completing these Kata's as I continue to learn. In addition, I have decided to incorporate unit testing into my solutions instead of just logging / printing results as a means of verifying my solutions. It was figuring out the best way to incorporate and structure this, that ultimately (_finally_) got me started on this repo.

## **The Content**

I really personally only learn by doing, not watching or reading. So I continue to learn my by continuing to practice. Rather than have an ever-increasing and disorganised directory of files that nobody except me ever saw, I offer my solutions publicly, I guess as a means of appreciation that this option for organisation and storage is available to me.

These are my solutions unless otherwise noted in an individual case. I do not profess their efficiency or suitability for their intended case; I am very much still in a learning phase. These solutions are not posted as means of teaching, instruction or direction. This repo is here, foremost, as a means of storage and organisation for my personal use, that I decided might as well be made available publicly.

## **Languages of Solutions**

The languages I've so far spent time with are the common first languages. Those are **JavaScript** and **Python**. More recently I have started to add **TypeScript** and **CoffeeScript** (_though I don't think the latter will continue_). In addition, I've dabbled a little into **Swift**. The Kata's will contain solutions for any of these languages that I have submitted a solution for.

## **Cheating!**

Obviously, these being publicly available to view, they may provide you with a means to produce and/or copy a solution to a given Kata. I would just say here, that if you are interested in learning coding, **_it will serve you far, far better to struggle through and get a successful result by your own means_** than to copy and paste a solution from me.

That said, you're going to do what you're going to do, so ... each to their own!

## **Thanks**

Quite possibly no one will ever actually read this, but it's not about that for me! But if you have stopped and looked through my repo, then... _**THANKS** for your interest!_
