## Kata Description


When working with color values it can sometimes be useful to extract the individual red, green, and blue (RGB) component values for a color. Implement a function that meets these requirements:



+ Accepts a case-insensitive hexadecimal color string as its parameter (ex. `"#FF9933"` or `"#ff9933"`)

+ Returns a Map<String, int> with the structure `{r: 255, g: 153, b: 51}` where *r*, *g*, and *b* range from 0 through 255



**Note:** your implementation does not need to support the shorthand form of hexadecimal notation (ie `"#FFF"`)





## Example



```

"#FF9933" --> {r: 255, g: 153, b: 51}

```
