## Kata Description


When working with color values it can sometimes be useful to extract the individual red, green, and blue (RGB) component values for a color. Implement a function that meets these requirements:



+ Accepts a case-insensitive hexadecimal color string as its parameter (ex. `"#FF9933"` or `"#ff9933"`)

+ Returns a Map<String, int> with the structure `{r: 255, g: 153, b: 51}` where *r*, *g*, and *b* range from 0 through 255



**Note:** your implementation does not need to support the shorthand form of hexadecimal notation (ie `"#FFF"`)





## Example



```

"#FF9933" --> {r: 255, g: 153, b: 51}

```

###### *The solutions in each language code file associated with this kata are my solutions unless otherwise noted in the code file.  Test cases are most often verbatim of those provided by the Kata.  However, in some cases it has been necessary to modify the test cases in order to have them function with my test runners and in my local environment.  On occasion, I may have added additional test cases to those provided.  Also, though I can't recall an instance, there may potentially have been reason to remove test cases for functional reasons.  Some Kata's also require (*or have*) code preloaded for their operation.  This code is included if it was required to make the tests work.  It is clearly identified under a **PRELOAD CODE** header if included.*

###### Most of my solutions are not commented (*though this will hopefully change*) as solutions are rarely submitted with comments on [Codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com).*
