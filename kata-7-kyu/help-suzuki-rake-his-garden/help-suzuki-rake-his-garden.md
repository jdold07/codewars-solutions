## Kata Description


Help Suzuki rake his garden!



The monastery has a magnificent Zen garden made of white gravel and rocks and it is raked diligently everyday by the monks. Suzuki having a keen eye is always on the lookout for anything creeping into the garden that must be removed during the daily raking such as insects or moss. 



You will be given a string representing the garden such as:



```

garden = 'gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel rock slug ant gravel gravel snail rock gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel slug gravel ant gravel gravel gravel gravel rock slug gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel snail gravel gravel rock gravel snail slug gravel gravel spider gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel moss gravel gravel gravel snail gravel gravel gravel ant gravel gravel moss gravel gravel gravel gravel snail gravel gravel gravel gravel slug gravel rock gravel gravel rock gravel gravel gravel gravel snail gravel gravel rock gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel spider gravel rock gravel gravel'

```

```

garden = 'slug spider rock gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel'

```

```

###### *The solutions in each language code file associated with this kata are my solutions unless otherwise noted in the code file.  Test cases are most often verbatim of those provided by the Kata.  However, in some cases it has been necessary to modify the test cases in order to have them function with my test runners and in my local environment.  On occasion, I may have added additional test cases to those provided.  Also, though I can't recall an instance, there may potentially have been reason to remove test cases for functional reasons.  Some Kata's also require (*or have*) code preloaded for their operation.  This code is included if it was required to make the tests work.  It is clearly identified under a **PRELOAD CODE** header if included.*

###### Most of my solutions are not commented (*though this will hopefully change*) as solutions are rarely submitted with comments on [Codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com).*
