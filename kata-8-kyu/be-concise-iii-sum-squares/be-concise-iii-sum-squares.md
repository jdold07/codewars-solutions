## Kata Description


# Be Concise III - Sum Squares



You are given a program ```sumSquares``` that takes an ```array``` as input and returns the sum of the squares of each item in an array.  For example:



```javascript

sumSquares([1,2,3,4,5]) === 55 // 1 ** 2 + 2 ** 2 + 3 ** 2 + 4 ** 2 + 5 ** 2

sumSquares([7,3,9,6,5]) === 200

sumSquares([11,13,15,18,2]) === 843

```



Shorten the code such that it meets the requirements.



A few hints:



1. Try researching about built-in Array methods; they may help shorten your code **a lot**



Good luck!

###### *This Kata description was compiled by [**tsdevau**](https://tsdev.au) with data provided by the [Codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com) API.*

###### *The solutions in each language code file associated with this kata are my solutions unless otherwise noted in the code file.  Test cases are most often verbatim of those provided by the Kata.  However, in some cases it has been necessary to modify the test cases in order to have them function with my test runners and in my local environment.  On occasion, I may have added additional test cases to those provided.  Also, though I can't recall an instance, there may potentially have been reason to remove test cases for functional reasons.  Some Kata's also require (*or have*) code preloaded for their operation.  This code is included if it was required to make the tests work.  It is clearly identified under a **PRELOAD CODE** header if included.*

###### Most of my solutions are not commented (*though this will hopefully change*) as solutions are rarely submitted with comments on [Codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com).*
